# Interview Questions
This repo contains problems that the NASA PETAL Team encounter. We would like to pose these challenges to potential interns. Potential interns are encouraged to find unique novel solutions to these problems, the solutions help us to improve our code.

# List of challenges
1. [Snorkel Challenge](https://github.com/nasa-petal/interview_questions/tree/main/snorkel_challenge): This challenge is about smart data management for a classification problem. The more labels you have and the more parameters the more memory you need. Is there a way to intelligently solve the problem while managing the memory usage?

2. [Airfoil Challenge](): Predicting airfoil performance using Machine Learning. How would you structure your neural network to predict the performance of the airfoil?
